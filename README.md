# Hi there ‚ú® 

My name is Christine and I'm a Software Engineer currently based in Philadelphia and originally from New York. I am a Healthcare turned Tech professional! It's been a bumpy road until I attended [App Academy's](https://www.appacademy.io/) immersive Software Engineering bootcamp where developed my fundamentals of data structures and algorithms. [Altus Empire](https://github.com/yangc95/altus-empire?organization=yangc95&organization=yangc95) is my first collaborative full stack project and [Leo](https://github.com/yangc95/Leo) is a work-in-progess pixel game.

Currently, I am with [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), working on some fun projects that involve reviewing and maintaining top quality content for learners of all backgrounds ‚Å†‚Äî especially new learners who may not know where to begin!

I'm active on Codecademy [Docs](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs). I also enjoy reading up on programming languages, technologies/stacks, and documentation ‚Å†‚Äî you name it!
